This is a Python package for fitting densities to scalar fields distributed on the domain of regular meshes.  This package is an implementation of the methodology described [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23110879/).  Rather than using the spatial coordinates of the mesh on which the data is distributed, this package fits isotropic distributions using the geodesic distances between mesh vertices.

Given a scalar field assigning, let's say, elevation values to latitude-longitude coordinates of Mount Rainier, we could use **fieldmodel** to fit a Gaussian distribution to this elevation profile.  The output of this fitting procedure would be 2 parameters: a ```mean``` parameter (centered on the true summit coordinates) and a ```sigma``` parameter, a measure of how quickly the elevation profile decays as we move away from the summit.

The code iterates over all possible ```mean``` locations in a set, and optimizes the ```sigma``` parameter using a **BFGS** minimization procedure.  I provide 3  optimality criteria options:

 1. maximization of spatial correlation
 2. maximization of signal amplitude
 3. minimization of least-squares error
 
 Along with fitting procedure, **fieldmodel** also offers some basic plotting functionality to visualize the fitted densities alongside the data to which those densities were fit.

## How to install and use:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kristianeschenburg/fieldmodel.git
cd  ./fieldmodel
pip install .
```

## Example application to synthetic data:
```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.io as sio

# Create fake distance matrix between and fake scalar map

# x coordinates for plotting
tx_file = '../data/target.X.mat'
tx = sio.loadmat(tx_file)['x'].squeeze()

# y coordinates for plotting
ty_file = '../data/target.Y.mat'
ty = sio.loadmat(ty_file)['y'].squeeze()

# geodesic distance matrix between vertices
dist_file = '../data/distance.mat'
dist = sio.loadmat(dist_file)['apsp']

# scalar field
field_file = '../data/scalar_field.mat'
field = sio.loadmat(field_file)['field'].squeeze()
```

Next, we can instantiate and fit our fieldmodel.  For more detail on the parameters, please refer to the ```docstring``` or ```Demo.ipynb``` in the ```demos``` directory.

```python
from fieldmodel import GeodesicFieldModel as GFM

# instantiate field model
G = GFM.FieldModel(r=10, amplitude=False,
                    peak_size=15, hood_size=20,
                    verbose=False, metric='pearson')

# fit field model
G.fit(data=field, distances=dist, x=tx, y=ty)
```

We can visualize the results of our model via the ```plot``` method in ```GFM.fieldmodel```:

```python
G.plot(field='pdf')
G.plot(field='amplitude')
G.plot(field='sigma')
```
