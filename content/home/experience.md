  * Developed computer vision models based on unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms for segmenting cortical tissue using adult human MRI, implemented in Python
  * Designed graph neural network models to apply existing population-level cortical maps to unmapped MRI images, improving segmentation accuracies by upwards of 15% relative to volumetric CNN models
  * Initiated cross-department study on resting-state brain dynamics using a novel modal decompoposition algorithm resulting in high-impact publication
  * Developed turn-key pipeline for processing high-resolution structural and functional MRI images to identify centroids of functional activation using bash, Python, and Java
  * Analyzed 1000+ adult human brain MRI scans (>1.5TB of data) using shell scripting and distributed computing tools (Sun Grid Engine)
  * Thesis work resulted in 2+ high-impact peer-reviewed publications, 2+ international conference posters, and 3+ conference presentations
