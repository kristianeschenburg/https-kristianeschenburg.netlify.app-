Backcountry skiing is a lot of work.  There's the organizing and packing of your gear, mapping out of your route, coordinating cars (if you're picking people up or doing a one-way ski), planning your meals, and ultimately, physically doing the dang thing.  But ultimately, those tasks individually aren't all that big of a deal.  Pretty much everything we do in life involves at least one of those things, and more often than not, multiple in conjunction.

Importantly, however, most of the routes we ski have at least, at one point or another *been skied* before -- someone has been there, they've taken pictures, they've written up a trip report.  At the very least, someone has seen it, described it, and put that information out for the world to do with what they will.

But sometimes, that just isn't the case.  Sometimes, you're on your own.  Sometimes, no one has been there.  Sometimes, people don't even know there's a line there that can be skied.  Randomly, you'll been scanning CalTopo or FatMap, and you'll sneak a peak at a narrow gully in the topography gradient, a slight discoloration in the steepness profile.  Does it go?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  You fit a polygon around the peak, add a marker to demarcate the possible drop, and close your browser tab, day-dreaming of ski descents that may never come to pass.

This is exactly what happened with Ross and I with Azurite Peak.  Except Ross's daydream became our reality.
