No, this was not a ski tour for my birthday... but it could have been!  The Birthday Tour is another classic PNW route on the east side of the North Cascades off of Highway 20 near Washington Pass.  This is a relatively quick tour, with a mild amount of elevation gain, but some pretty enjoyable downhill bits.
