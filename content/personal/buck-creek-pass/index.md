My friend David moved to London recently, so we set out to do a long trail-run before he left the States.  We decided on Buck Creek Pass Loop, a 36 mile loop on the east side of Glacier Peak in the Easter Cascades.  It had been on my list for a long time, and I was considering doing it solo for a while, but am glad David ended up joining.  We camped near the trailhead the night before, and departed for the long slog around 6am.  This wasn't my longest run, but this one definitely hurt the most.  Scroll down for some beautiful scenery, courtesy of David's fancy camera!
