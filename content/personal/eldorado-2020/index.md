It's that time of year again!  Every year for the past few years, I done a solo ski tour of Eldorado Peak in the North Cascades.  This doesn't preclude doing it with friends -- it's just a climb that really tests your mettle (you gain a little over 7000 feet in roughly 5 miles), and sometimes I want to attempt this sufferfest in peace!  Eldorado is one of the crown jewels of the Cascade Range, and one of [North America's 50 Classic Ski Descents](http://www.50classicskidescents.com/purchase/x1xxh13ni4z63kst126tktaolp10xy). I've been lucky to have pretty good snow conditions for each of my attempts, although the same can't always be said for the weather!
