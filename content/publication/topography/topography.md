abstract: "Analyzing connectivity between pairs of cortical regions is important for understanding how the brain is structured and how it transmits information. Various cortical areas show graded organization along intrinsic axes defined by functional connectivity ([Guell et al.](https://elifesciences.org/articles/36652) and [Langers et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3412441/)). Recent work applies Laplacian eigenmaps to characterize gradients (connectopies) ([Haak et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811917305463)) but stops short of relating gradients between region pairs. [O'Rawe et al.](https://www.eneuro.org/content/early/2020/01/27/ENEURO.0532-19.2019/tab-article-info?versioned=true) introduce the idea of pairwise regional linear mapping. Using 150 HCP ([Glasser et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3720813/)) subjects and corresponding HCP-MMP parcellations, we build off the work by [O'Rawe et al.](https://www.eneuro.org/content/early/2020/01/27/ENEURO.0532-19.2019/tab-article-info?versioned=true) to relate pairwise linear maps to the intrinsic axes defined by functional connectivity."


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Using non-linear dimensionality reduction of functional brain connectivity patterns, and multivariate spatial statistics to characterize the functional embeddings, we analyze the spatial relationships between pairs of cortical regions to better examine how pairs of cortical regions connect and relate to one another.
